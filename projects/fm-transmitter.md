## Details

I take a trip to the dollar store every now and then just to see what deals I can find. On my last trip I found an FM transmitter in the electronics section made to be powered and used by a [Sony PSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable). For one dollar, this thing was likely being offloaded below cost. I'd actually been looking for a way to add wireless audio to my room for a while, and since I didn't have plans that Sunday afternoon I decided to grab the cheap little device and expand its capabilities. You can find more information about my modifications to the FM Transmitter in the video below.
