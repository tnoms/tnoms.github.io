## Details

I first had the idea for this project while I was in high school. My baby cousin got an [Alphabet Pal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYxFhv6CSJk) for his birthday, and I was charged with liberating the toy from its packaging and loading it with batteries. Once I powered it up, I recognized the toy's true potential: a drum machine. The Alphabet Pal has a "letter sounds" function which, as the name implies, makes the sound of a letter in the alphabet corresponding to the button pressed. Perfect for making some beats. The following week I went out and bought my own Alphabet Pal, replaced the speaker with an audio output jack, plugged it into my guitar amp, and jammed.

When [circuit bending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovh-yCAJUYs) started to take off later that year, I knew the Alphabet Pal needed to be dissected once again. Sadly my experience with electronics was limited at that time, and the idea of reverse engineering a complex design was too daunting. I shelved the project and simply used the toy as a beat box for the next few years. Then in early 2012, I discovered [this video buried in the depths of YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i_fXLHLKpQ).

Not be outdone by a random guy on the internet who had the same idea as me, I disassembled the toy and tested various components to deduce their function. The project was still a little overwhelming considering my electrical engineering degree has taught me virtually nothing about electronics design thus far, but Google and reddit had my back. After a few hours banging my head against the wall, I was able to pinpoint the circuit responsible for playback rate control. I swapped the resistors which controlled the rate for a couple of potentiometers to be used for coarse and fine tuning. After testing, I added some knobs and put it all back together. The result: A truly horrifying musical caterpillar.
