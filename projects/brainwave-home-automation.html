<h1>Brainwave Controlled Home Automation</h1>

<h4>January 18, 2012</h4>

<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>DIY solution to control room lights with brainwave activity, voice commands, and smartphone. Home automation features include smartphone alarm clock integration; which optimizes wake-up time to match sleep cycles, gently turns on the lights, speaks the morning weather, and plays music on the stereo.</p>

<p><strong>Time Invested</strong>: 4 days<br />
<strong>Cost (Outlet Remote)</strong>: $25<br />
<strong>Cost (Mindflex EEG)</strong>: $40<br />
<strong>Features</strong>:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Control lights with brain, voice, smartphone, computer</li>
<li>Alarm clock integration with sleep cycle optimization</li>
<li>Spoken morning weather forecast &amp; music</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Ever since I watched the Disney Channel original movie "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxUZb3WnTpo">Smart House</a>" as a kid, I've been determined to build a real smart house for myself. In the summer of 2011, I purchased a wireless outlet controller with three switched outlets at my local hardware store. It was a low-cost RF system with no capability for WiFi control, but my intention was to change that.</p>

<p>Just before the beginning of the spring semester I cracked open the remote control to figure out how it worked and, more importantly, figure out how to emulate button presses with a microcontroller. After a bit of experimentation and probing, I found an array of diodes on the circuit board where a HIGH signal could be introduced to emulate a button press. I soldered on a few leads, wrote an Arduino sketch to translate commands from my computer, and used that data to toggle the three wireless switches in my room.</p>

<p>Having been recently introduced to the automation tool <a href="http://www.eventghost.net/">EventGhost</a> while configuring a network remote for <a href="https://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a>, I chose it to expand the capabilities of my light controller. Inside EventGhost, I configured macros to send serial data to my light controller in response to key combinations on my keyboard. Next, I leveraged the EventGhost <a href="https://github.com/timhoeck/eventghost-android">Android app</a> to control my lights with my phone and employed the EventGhost <a href="http://www.eventghost.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=18&start=30">SpeechRecognition plugin</a> to control my lights with my voice. Inspired by a video I saw in late 2011 called <a href="https://vimeo.com/10184668">Brain Hack</a>, I also resolved to control my lights with my brain. I didn't expect it to be a practical means of control by any stretch of the imagination, but it was fun to add as a proof of concept. I acquired a Mattel Mindflex, found the Neurosky EEG module inside, and grabbed serial data from it using Erik Mika's <a href="https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Arduino-Brain-Library">brain library for Arduino</a>. Using that data I was able to control my lights using the brainwave activity in my prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>The last feature I added was an alarm clock function. I configured macros in EventGhost that, when triggered by the Android app, set a timer for 194, 374, or 464 minutes and ran an alarm clock function after the timer ran out. (Those times were selected based on a 90 minute sleep cycle and the fact that the average person takes 14 minutes to fall asleep â€“ the same reasearch based assumptions used in the <a href="https://sleepyti.me/">sleepyti.me bedtime calculator</a>.) The alarm starts by quietly playing a song from my "wake up" playlist and turns on LED Christmas lights to wake me up gently. Next, it gets the local forecast from Google using the <a href="http://www.eventghost.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1996">EventGhost Weather plugin,</a> speaks the weather aloud using text-to-speech, and tells me the current time. Finally, it increases the music volume to "time to get up" levels and turns on the rest of my lights. Using <a href="https://tasker.joaoapps.com/">Tasker</a> I configured this entire process to be triggered by setting a regular alarm on my phone.</p>
