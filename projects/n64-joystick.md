## Details

After years of dealing with loose, worn out joysticks on my Nintendo 64 controllers, I finally got around to replacing them with [fancy new ones](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Replacement-Joystick-Installation-sScrewdriver/dp/B0058FLXZ8/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt). The new joysticks have a smoother action and better performance than the original joysticks, which I think is great. Some people find them to be _too perfect_ with a faster response time than the original joysticks that takes some getting used to.  
  
Part two of this project is getting all of the controllers working with an emulator on my PC using [N64 USB adapters](https://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-Adapter-Nintendo-Controller-Converter/dp/B003ZKCFDC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1316036771&sr=8-2), then integrating the emulator into [XBMC](https://xbmc.org/about/). I've tried interfacing with XBMC before and failed, because Project64 – the emulator compatible with most games – doesn't always play nice with XBMC. I can, however, play emulated Nintendo 64 games outside of XBMC, re-rendered in 1080p HD using a plug-in called nGlide. I'll work through the software issues of XBMC integration over the next weeks.
