    High Quality Scanning of Old Photo Negatives
  </h1>
  <p>
    This is a tutorial for scanning old negatives using a
    <a

  <h2 id="negatives-scanning-process">Negatives Scanning Process</h2>
  <p>Load a strip of negatives into the tray.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wear white cotton gloves to avoid getting grease on the negatives.</li>
    <li>Remove any dust using the air blaster bulb.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Gently insert the tray into scanner until you feel a slight click.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Initial software setup</strong> is completed once per scanning
    session. <strong>Scanning steps</strong> are completed for each individual
    negative.
  </p>
  <h3 id="initial-software-setup">Initial software setup</h3>
  <p>
    Run the <strong>SilverFast 9</strong> software, then click
    <strong>Start</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click <strong>Cancel</strong> if the software complains that it&#39;s
    waiting for a printer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click <strong>WorkflowPilot</strong> in the top left corner to activate the
    scanning wizard. This tool simplifies the scanning process.
  </p>
  <p>

      alt="Enable the WorkflowPilot wizard"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <strong>WorkflowPilot</strong>, set the <strong>Source</strong> to
    <strong>Negative</strong> and the <strong>Task</strong> to
    <strong>Web</strong>.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Source: Negative
Task: Web
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Then, click <strong>Start</strong> to advance to the
    <strong>ME</strong> section.
  </p>
  <p>

      src="https://i.postimg.cc/yYxs5zZS/2.png"
      alt="Set source to Negative and task to Web"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <strong>ME</strong> section, ensure that Multi-Exposure (ME) is
    enabled. A red indicator will be shown next to the ME icon to confirm that
    it&#39;s enabled. <strong>No action</strong> should be required.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, click the <strong>right arrow</strong> to advance to
    <strong>Prescan</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h3 id="scanning-steps">Scanning steps</h3>
  <p>
    A prescan will run automatically when <strong>Prescan</strong> is selected.
    This creates a fast, low-quality preview used to make adjustments prior to
    running the final scan. After the prescan is complete, the software should
    automatically advance to the
    <strong>Frames &amp; Resolution</strong> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the <strong>Rot/Flip (Compass Button)</strong> to rotate and flip image
    as needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Click and drag</strong> the red box around image to capture as much
    of it as possible in the final scan. Some black borders may make it through
    to the end. That&#39;s okay as long as import parts of the photo aren&#39;t
    cut off.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em
      >Note: If the negative strip is not aligned properly in the tray, large
      black borders will be visible and parts of the image will be cut off. To
      realign the negative strip, remove the tray, center the negative, reinsert
      the tray, and click <strong>Prescan</strong> again to update the
      preview.</em

  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="https://i.postimg.cc/rw2Z41MF/4.png"
      alt="Rotate, flip, and crop as needed"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    After cropping, ensure that the <strong>Scan resolution</strong> is set to
    the second highest setting, <strong>3600ppi</strong>. This should be the
    default. The highest setting is overkill, takes too long to scan, and will
    create gigantic photos (~200 MB) that basically just accentuate the film
    grain when zoomed in.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Scan resolution: 3600ppi
</code></pre>
  <p>
    <img
      src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPMyfPVs/5.png"
      alt="Set scan resolution to 3600ppi"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, configure the <strong>NegaFix</strong> settings. This is an important
    step to ensure that the colors are correct in the scanned image.
  </p>
  <p>
    Select the appropriate <strong>Vendor</strong>, <strong>Type</strong>, and
    <strong>ISO/ASA</strong> based on the film used to capture the photo. The
    film type is typically indicated in small text at the top of the negative
    strip. It can be difficult to decipher the text on the negative strip, so
    you might need to Google what you read to figure out which settings to
    select. For example:
  </p>
  <pre><code>KODAK GT. 800-4 = Kodak Max Zoom 800
KODAK CX 100 = Kodak Ektar 100
KODAK 5100 EKTAR 25-1 = Kodak Ektar 100 &amp; Exposure=-0.5 (compensation for lack of support for Ektar 25)
</code></pre>
  <p>
    After identifying the film for NegaFix, click the
    <strong>right arrow</strong> to advance to <strong>Auto</strong> settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="https://i.postimg.cc/MTZppfv9/6.png"
      alt="Identify the film for NegaFix"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <strong>Auto</strong> settings, let the software automatically adjust
    the the <strong>Input Histogram</strong> and <strong>Gradiation</strong>.
    Less is more here. Sometimes the settings chosen by the software will make
    the image too bright or too dark. If that&#39;s the case, disable them by
    clicking the <strong>checkmarks</strong> next to each setting. It&#39;s best
    to start with a neutral scan, then edit the image later to avoid losing
    data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once this check is complete, click the <strong>right arrow</strong> to
    advance to the <strong>iSRD</strong> section.
  </p>
  <p>

      alt="Uncheck the boxes if it&#39;s too bright or too dark"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the the <strong>iSRD</strong> section, ensure the
    <strong>Mode</strong> is set to <strong>Correct</strong>, the
    <strong>Automatic</strong> box is <strong>checked</strong>. These should be
    the default settings.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Mode: Correct
Automatic: *check*
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Then, click the <strong>right arrow</strong> to advance to
    <strong>Export Options</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="https://i.postimg.cc/QtcwwfXP/8.png"
      alt="Set Mode to Correct and check the Automatic box"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <strong>Export Options</strong>, configure the settings used to save
    all photos that will be scanned during the current scanning session.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Input a <strong>File Name</strong> for the scanning session using the most
      accurate date you can provide. My preferred format is Year-Month-Day.
      However, unless the photos are from a holiday or birthday party, I doubt
      the exact date will be known. Do the best you can; e.g. 1992-Fall,
      1992-09, 1992-12, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set <strong>Numbering</strong> to <strong>Sequential</strong> to
      automatically save photos with sequential numbering; e.g. 1992-Fall_1.tif,
      1992-Fall_2.tif, 1992-Fall_3.tif, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set the <strong>Start Index</strong> to <strong>1</strong> for every new
      photo album. This is a nerdy way for the software to ask where to start
      counting. You can change this if you want to continue counting from some
      other number.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure that <strong>Export To</strong> is set to
      <strong>Custom</strong> and the <strong>Upload</strong> folder on the
      Desktop is selected. This is the location that scanned photos will be
      saved to. Everything inside the Upload folder is automatically uploaded to
      my server and backed up.
    </li>
    <li>Use the <strong>TIFF</strong> file format to preserve quality.</li>
  </ul>
  <pre><code>File Name: &lt;something descriptive&gt; (e.g. 1992-Fall)
Numbering: Sequential
Start Index: 1
Export To: Custom
File Format: TIFF
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Once everything is set, click <strong>Next</strong> to
    <strong>Scan &amp; Process</strong> the image.
  </p>

      alt="Configure Export Options for saving scanned photos"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    After a successful scan, advance the tray in the scanner until you feel a
    slight click to get to the to the next negative.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click <strong>Prescan</strong> and repeat the
    <strong>Scanning steps</strong> process. Very few settings changes will be
    required for new negatives in the same album, if any. When a prescan reveals
    that a photo is blurry or not worth keeping, just move to the next one and
    click <strong>Prescan</strong> again to update the preview.
  </p>

    Original scans in TIF format are large and mostly useful for archiving
    photos in high quality. They enable old photos to be given new life through
    editing. For everyday use, however, the JPG format is better.
  </p>
  <p>
    To convert all scanned photos to JPG for immediate use on social media,
    email, etc, double click the <strong>Convert</strong> icon on the Desktop.
    This tool will convert all TIF images in the Upload folder to the JPG format
    and copy them to the Scanned Pictures folder.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Photos inside the <strong>Scanned Pictures</strong> folder may be renamed,
    reorganized, moved, copied, uploaded to social media, etc. This folder is
    not monitored and uploaded to the server.
