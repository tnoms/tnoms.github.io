<p>
	From taking apart electronics as a child, building HTML/CSS web pages in elementary school, to inadvertently learning BASIC in 7th grade <a href="http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/games">building games</a> on my <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-83-plus">TI-83 calculator</a>, I've been fascinated with technology from a young age. In high school, I studied university level computer science and learned the fundamentals of electronics design.
</p>
<p>
	I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering with a Digital Signal Processing focus and was a top experimental researcher at Texas A&M University's Wireless Communications Laboratory. While my studies focused on math, physics, and theory, I honed my practical skills on the side. Self-learning online sparked my creativity, equipping me with the knowledge and skills to utilize sensors and wireless radios, build embedded systems with them, and spin up servers to take action with the data. Combining those skills with my fascination with neuroscience led me to build a simple brain-computer interface before my studies had even touched on anything practical.
</p>
<p>
	I'm a lifelong learner who's worked with a variety of technologies. My professional career started in the semiconductor industry as a technical advisor for wireless technologies, edge AI, advanced sensors, and microcontrollers. Starting at the ground level, I rose to support engineering executives at multi-national firms and their global teams with system level solutions. In the enterprise software world, I've helped architect AI solutions and custom search tools for Fortune 500 companies as well as government agencies.
</p>
<p>
	I served as Chief Operating Officer for the <a href="https://inspire.mindbreeze.com/">Mindbreeze Corporation</a>, running their US branch. I am currently an independent consultant and advisor to firms implementing generative AI solutions.
